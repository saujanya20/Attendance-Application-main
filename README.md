A system is in place to ensure employees can only mark their attendance when they are physically located at the office. Hello, fellow developers! ✨

My Bhilai Steel Plant Training program journey culminated in an exciting project I'm eager to share! This program provided an incredible opportunity to delve into the world of app development.

Introducing the Geological Employee Attendance Application! ⚒️

This app, meticulously designed with Figma, offers a smooth and efficient solution for tracking employee attendance in geological settings. Built using the powerful Flutter framework, the app boasts a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality. Rounding out the package, SQLite integration provides a robust backend for the application.

A huge thanks to everyone who provided guidance and support throughout this journey. It has helped me evolve into a more skilled and resourceful developer.

I'm open to your feedback! Let's connect and explore new possibilities together.
