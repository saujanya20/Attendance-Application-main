## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Hello Gitters âœ¨ 
I am excited to share the culmination of our Bhilai Steel Plant Training program journey!
During this enriching experience, We had the fantastic opportunity to dive into the world of app development. I'm thrilled to present the Geological Employee Attendance Application that I crafted using Flutter, SQLite, and Figma!
Designed with precision using Figma, this app brings a seamless and efficient solution to track employee attendance within geological settings.
Leveraging the power of Flutter, we ensured a user-friendly interface and smooth functionality
SQLite integration fortified the app's backend
I'm immensely grateful for the guidance and support received throughout this journey, shaping me into a more proficient and resourceful professional.
I'm open to feedback and eager to explore.
